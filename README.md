# Finding the greatest Formula One Driver using Elo Ranking

Amongst fans of Formula One, it is hotly disputed who is the greatest Formula One driver of all time. Some think it's modern greats like Hamilton or Vettel, others think old-school drivers like Schumacher or Prost are the greatest. This project aims to settle this debate once and for all by using the same ranking system used for the chess, the ELO ranking system.

## What is ELO Ranking?

The ELO ranking system is a method of rating the relative skill levels of players in competitive games, such as chess, football, or video games. Developed by Hungarian-American physicist Arpad Elo in the 1960s, the system works by assigning each player an initial rating based on their past performance and then updating that rating based on the outcome of each game they play.

Each driver was compared to their team mate(s), updating their respective elo scores after each race.

The data was acquired from Kaggle. Here is the link to the data set :
